# Repair Shop
This is an application for managing the repair-shop. It can handle any kind of repair shop for example phone, computer or bike.
It can help you with managing a stock and budget. Clients can also check their repair status.

It will have an option for dynamically generate PDFs forms for clients which can save a lot of time.
